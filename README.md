NStack - A bootstrapping framework for .NET applications
============

There are many stack frameworks and application bootstrappers for .NET. This is mine. The core is for bootstrapping configuration, logging and instrumentation, security, data access, and other cross-cutting concerns. Additionally, other useful features will be added as one-off libraries.

Eventually, NStack will feature the ability to pick components and merge into a minimal set of libraries and dependencies, so you can plug into your application only what you need.

Ugh, not another one of these. Why should I care about yours?

I have been carrying around lots of useful tools in various toolboxes, as I've assembled them over the years. This is an attempt to shore them up, formalize them, and make them work harder for me and anyone else that feels like using them. I'm very particular, and I have a tendancy to pull things I find apart and put them back together (throwing out stuff that I don't care for or need). Use mine or don't.

Who are you?

I'm currently writing this at my own pleasure. I will welcome collaborators and contributors, and when such folks present themselves, I'll be happy to create a formal plan for features and begin milestones. Until then, use whatevery you'd like, and send me any issues or pull requests you come up with along the way.
